# Caves-CliffsSimulator
A data package that makes it possible to "generate" all the new biomes of 1.17.

This data pack adds lush and dripstone caves decorators to the default Minecraft world. These generation changes makes it possible to see (in a way) what the caves would look like with the biomes of this update.



As I' have said before, the datapack doesn't change the structure of the world in terms of biomes (which means that it does not generate 3D biomes) but makes it possible for certain biomes to generate the structures that you would find in lush or dripstone biomes (stalactites in a desert for example).
